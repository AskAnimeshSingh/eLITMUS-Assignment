//Backend APIs:

//POST /start-test
//Input: { name: string, email: string, invitationCode: string }
//Output: { success: boolean }

//Description: This API is used to start a new test for a user. It receives the user's name, email, and invitation code from the Chrome extension and stores the details in the database. It returns a success status to the Chrome extension.

//POST /capture-image
//Input: { imageData: string, timestamp: number }
//Output: { success: boolean }
//Description: This API is used to capture and store an image of the assessment page. It receives the image data and timestamp from the Chrome extension and stores the image in the image storage component. It also stores the timestamp in the database for future reference. It returns a success status to the Chrome extension.

//Backend Implementation:
//API Server: We can use any web framework to create the API server. In this, we will use Node.js and Express.js to create the API server.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// configure middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// configure API routes
app.post('/start-test', (req, res) => {
  // TODO: validate user inputs and store in database
  res.json({ success: true });
});

app.post('/capture-image', (req, res) => {
  // TODO: store image data and timestamp in image storage and database
  res.json({ success: true });
});

// start API server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`API server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
//Database: We can use any database to store user details and image timestamps. In this example, we will use MongoDB to create the database

// create a database
use elitmusexam

// create a collection to store user information
db.createCollection("users")

// create a document to store user information
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
  invitation_code: "abc123",
  created_at: new Date(),
  updated_at: new Date()
})

// create a collection to store images
db.createCollection("images")

// create a document to store image information
db.images.insertOne({
  user_id: 1,
  image_url: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  image_description: "The candidate's face is visible.",
  created_at: new Date()
})

//This creates a new MongoDB database called elitmusexam and two collections: users and images. The users collection stores the user information such as their name, email, and invitation code along with timestamps for when the document was created and updated. The images collection stores the image information including the user ID, image URL, image description, and timestamp for when the document was created.
